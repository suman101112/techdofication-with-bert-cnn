# techdofication-with-bert-cnn
technical domain identification with multilingual bert and convolutional models.

This can be run on any text classification task.

The program is run on Google colab.

NN library used is pytorch
hugging face "transformers" library is used for the bert model.
The CNN architecture is obtained from "Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification".
